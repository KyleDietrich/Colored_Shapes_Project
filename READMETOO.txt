I'm lazy and dont want use git task tracking so,
im just gonna type stuff here when i work on it

WHAT I DID SO FAR:

-- Image generation should be working 

-- defined our loss functions in loss_functions.py

-- outlined the file for the autonconder model
		youll probably need to import some more pytorch stuff

-- trained constrastive learning model (SmallCNN)

-- finished constrastive training function

-- Test trained the constrative model. Looks like itll take about 2 hour 

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE STILL
-- construct Autoencode (encoder + decoder) model
-- set up training loops for autencoder model
-- Train autoencdoer 
-- visualize data

-- make slides for presentation
-- probably write a report maybe the README will be enough if we make it detailed
