I'm lazy and dont want use git task tracking so,
im just gonna type stuff here when i work on it

WHAT I DID SO FAR:

-- Image generation should be working at least in my singular tests it has worked
		I have yet to do a large dataset yet so we will see...

-- defined our loss functions in loss_functions.py

-- outlined the file for the autonconder model
		youll probably need to import some more pytorch stuff

-- outlined the contrastive learning expirement
		I did more for this since youll be working on autoencoder part

-- outlined the training functions

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE STILL
-- full test on dataset generation
-- construct both models
-- set up training loops for both models
-- actually TRAIN the models
-- visualize data

-- make slides for presentation
-- probably write a report maybe the README will be enough if we make it detailed
